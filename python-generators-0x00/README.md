# Python Generators Exercises - ALX Backend

## Overview

This project contains a series of exercises to practice **Python generators** with SQL databases. Generators are memory-efficient ways to iterate over large datasets **one item at a time**.

We use **MySQL** as the database and **Python** to connect, fetch, and process data in different ways.
